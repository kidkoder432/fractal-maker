This repository contains two fractal generators (more will be added in the future):

## 1. Sierpinski Triangle 
This generator creates a fractal called the Sierpinski Triangle. It first generates Pascal's Triangle (read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)) and then colors every odd number black and every even number white, or whichever colors you would like to use.

## 2. Koch Curve
This generator creates a Koch curve (read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake)) by using an L-system (from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake#Representation_as_Lindenmayer_system)).
